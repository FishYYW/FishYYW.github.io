## Welcome to YYW's Github Page

I'm currently a sophormore student majoring in ECE but have a great passion for CS.
(The fact is I learn very little about this field except from basic algorithm knowledge I got during high school.)
But here, I'd love to code more, learn more and maybe get a chance to contribute to others.

###What you may find in my repo?

- programming homework of courses I take (including and especially online ones)
- small apps on iOS platform
- funny stuff forked by me

*Just a simple introduce to me and why I am here*
